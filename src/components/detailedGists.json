So here is my guide.\n\nHow it is done?\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nCreate a new project, save it in a specific folder (we need this location later). Once the schematic capture screen appears,\n\nCreate a 2D graphics for the module. (2 input, 2 output, 1Gnd)\n\nUse 2D graphics box tool and Device pins mode to create the block diagram.\n\nDefine the functions of pins(Type- Input, Output,Power)\n\nThe name of pin is a constant that links to the internal circuit that we draw later. (S,R, D-,D,Gnd)\n\nOnce this is done, select the whole module and right click-> Make device.\n\nMake device dialog box appears. Enter device name and Module name.\n\nDevice name is name of the device in library. Module name is the name of internal circuit that we add soon. Click next.\n\nAdd the PCB package. (I used DIL 6 here) (Click add/edit- click add- type DIL and choose DIL06 from integrated circuit category.\n\nClick Assign Package.\n\nClick next few times till you reach Indexing and Library selection.\n\nThis is the category in library where it will save the device. I chose Miscellaneous.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe creation of Component is over.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow we have to link it with the module. From library, choose the part we just created, place it on schematic. I said this because, the 2D graphics that is on the schematic is not a component. It is still a 2D graphics.\n\nSee, individual components are still discrete and not a single unit. (It is 2D graphics)\n\nThe component will have all pins, box etc assembled as a single unit.\n\nNote the difference in selection of both.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you place the actual assembled component, right click and click go to child sheet.\n\nIf this option is greyed out, right click on component, go to edit properties, make sure add hierarchy module is checked.\n\nGo to child mode brings you to a new empty sheet.\n\nDraw the internal schematic here using active components. (That works in simulation)\n\nMark the terminals using terminals mode.\n\nMake sure you use Input pins, Output pins etc specified as in your block created earlier.\n\nThe names of the pins should be identical.\n\nOnce you have done everything, click on Design- Edit sheet properties.\n\nEnter the name of Module in the box. It should be the same that you entered earlier. (SRFPI in my case) *Check mod file and Click ok.\n\nRight click and click exit to parent.\n\nThe module is now created.\n\nClick on File-> Save project.\n\nThis creates a.MOD file in the folder. (The location I cited in first part )\n\nWhenever you wish to use this particular component, Make sure this MOD file is in that work folder.\n\nIf MOD file is not present in that folder, the component will have empty child sheet in that project.\n\nIf everything is correct, the Child sheet will have the circuit you designed.\n\nIf the child sheet is blank, it means MOD file is not detected. Save the project, close proteus, add the .MOD file to work folder of project, relaunch the proteus project.\n\nAlso, if you add the mod file only after creating the schematic, make sure you reload the project. Any changes in folder will be recognized only at the launching of the project.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPS: SRFPI means SR flip flop- internal, but it is in fact a latch, not FF. Not gonna change it though."
